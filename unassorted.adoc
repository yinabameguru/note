== Driving agile development with test-driven development

why refactor?::

- Refactoring makes your organization’s code simpler, which means fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

- If you have fewer code lines, you will have fewer potential bugs

- Simpler code enables technical agility,Technical agility enables business agility

how to refactor?::

- TDD TDD is an iterative process or a three-step dance—red, green, refactor

-  instead of doing a single large refactoring, doing a series of smaller microrefactorings

- DRY-Don‘t Repeat Yourself


TDD three-step—red, green, refactor::

- Write a new test for that new feature; of course, the code will fail the test because the feature doesn’t work yet. TDD says the test has gone red.

- Write Java code to implement the new feature until the new test passes. All the other tests must continue passing as well. This means the tests have gone green.

- Clean up and improve the production code by refactoring the code, which results in better code. All the tests must continue to pass.

code kata::
 - kata is a series of movements that you do regularly. You repeat your actions so many times that the body builds muscle memory. Without thinking about them, you will execute the moves.

== Stabilizing your legacy code and technical debt

https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata[GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata]

what's technical debt?::
- Technical debt is code with problems that can be improved with refactoring or code without automated tests

the interest payments::
- the biggest cost is lost of technecal agility,and then lose the business technecal

why is technical debt a problem?::
- taking the time to fix the code to improve technical and business agility

how to do?::

- using test-refactor-add methodology for working with legacy code

step::

- Add pin-down tests. They will help you understand the legacy code’s external behavior, and they will also pin down the code’s behavior so that if something breaks, you’ll know it.

- Discover more behaviors with code coverage tools

- Testing if/else statements by branch coverage

- Refactor

- Add the new feature

= CodeKata

what is the goal?::

- the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.

what's crud?::
- create,read,update,delete

== 判断null/empty的偷懒方法
org.springframework.util.ObjectUtils.isEmpty

支持Optional、Array、CharSequence、Collection、Map


= JSON

spring 序列化json，会去掉is字段 isDailyRule -> dailyRule

= es

200+条数据 文档也很简单，但是存储占用空间很大 一个分片300M,原因是频繁写入，es删除有延迟

== AsciidocFx 导出pdf

AsciidocFx的默认字体不支持导出pdf中的中文字体，解决方法是在导出pdf时选择一种支持中文的字体。

修改/conf/docbook-config/fo-pdf.xsl

. Add some font that can display Chinese into <xsl:template name="pickfont-symbol">. Some supported fonts are Arial Unicode MS, SimSun, SimHei, KaiTi. It seems bold font does not work for SimSun, SimHei, KaiTi.

. Uncomment <xsl:param name="symbol.font.family">.
