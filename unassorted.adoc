# refactor

why refactor?::

- Refactoring makes your organization’s code simpler, which means fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

- If you have fewer code lines, you will have fewer potential bugs

- Simpler code enables technical agility,Technical agility enables business agility

how to refactor?::

- TDD TDD is an iterative process or a three-step dance—red, green, refactor

-  instead of doing a single large refactoring, doing a series of smaller microrefactorings

- DRY-Don‘t Repeat Yourself


TDD three-step—red, green, refactor::

- Write a new test for that new feature; of course, the code will fail the test because the feature doesn’t work yet. TDD says the test has gone red.

- Write Java code to implement the new feature until the new test passes. All the other tests must continue passing as well. This means the tests have gone green.

- Clean up and improve the production code by refactoring the code, which results in better code. All the tests must continue to pass.
